<h2>What the 3Rs System is not.
</h2>
<p>The 3Rs System is  not a series of required exercises,  a juice or smoothie fast, or a motivational system. It is not something that requires you to bust it at the gym, or join scheduled classes with a trainer. A lifestyle change is also not required, but merely a few simple dietary steps for you to follow. Steps, that when adhered to for a couple of weeks, could potentially be turned into positive, healthy habits. This could be part of your daily routine which shapes your health.
</p>
<p>Thatâ€™s right! The 3Rs System is designed to not only provide you with steps for better health today, but also to practice good habits that could bode well for your future health. It can also strengthen your immune system, boost your energy, and protect you from the damaging effects of stress.
