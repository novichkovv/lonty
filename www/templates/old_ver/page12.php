<blockquote><i>This 3Rs System was actually easier than I thought it would be, and I must say the results speak for themselves.  I lost eight pounds and my blood pressure has dropped to 110/70. I have an heightened sense of smell. I also was able to focus at work easier, and my ability to meditate and pray was easier as I wasn't agitated. This is the best way to start the New Year, and dare I say it, I am looking forward to the next one.

    <i>The 3Rs System was just awe-inspiring. I realized I had so much energy that I was buzzing around the house doing projects I had been putting off for months after implementing it. On Sunday, afternoon my dog and I went for a long hike in a wilderness area not far from my house. The colors, smells, and sights seemed to be so intense I sometimes felt like I was under the influence of a narcotic! I only wish there was a way I could convert and convince more people of the value of this.
