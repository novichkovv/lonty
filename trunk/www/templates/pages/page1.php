<h2>The Secret to A Healthy, Youthful Life Revealed
    By Dr. Don Colbert</h2>
<p>It is said that your body is the temple of your soul. It is the only place you have to live. The only thing that is truly yours; the greatest instrument you will ever own. This proves just how important it is to take care of your body for your overall health and wellness, and for your happiness and well-being.
</p>
<p>You try to do everything you can to care for your body such as exercising, eating a healthy diet while watching what you eat and drink, and following a healthy sleeping habit getting around 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep. However, sometimes you still find yourself afflicted with unpleasant symptoms such as feeling bloated after a fairly light meal, lethargic after resting well, or feeling fatigued after climbing a small set of stairs. You consider yourself a fairly healthy individual, so why is this happening?
</p>
<h2>Is there something wrong with me?
</h2>
<p>It is only normal to question yourself in reference to your health and overall well-being when you do not feel like you are functioning 100%, even if it happens irregularly. Because of this unwanted feeling that is possibly hindering you from loving, laughing, and living freely and fully, you are determined to find out the root cause of the problem. Well, here is where you can stop seeking, and start to learn and get the answers. Keep reading ahead because I will be informing you as to why you are feeling these symptoms.  Moreover, I provide you with a definite solution.
</p>
<h2>You cannot beat what you can’t see.</h2>
<p>Believe it not, the reason why you are suffering from an array of hindering ailments is largely due to substances that are accumulated in your body’s internal cells, known as toxins, by simply eating, breathing, and drinking. Regardless of whether you think you are eating the right food, practicing wellness techniques, and maintaining your stress levels, toxins will eventually find their way to build up in your body and pose a risk to your health. </p>
<h2>What are toxins and why are they harmful to your health?
</h2>
<p>
    Though the word toxin is always thought to be bad, however, not many understand why exactly it is. Most people don't understand what toxins are, and how they can accumulate in your body. High levels of toxins can cause stress on your body systems, disease, and make your body seem sluggish and full of complications. The basic definition of a toxin is a chemical or poison that is known to have harmful effects on the body. It is in everything that you consume and it can originate from a variety of sources, such as medicines, personal grooming products, cleaning products, air, light, and even noise. You cannot avoid it, and it can be almost everywhere you go, and everything you consume can expose you to toxins.
</p>
<p>Thankfully, toxins that are accumulated in your body have a way of being flushed out of your system via vital organs, such as the liver, kidneys, and colon in the form of sweat, urine, and feces.  Though these organs do an excellent job, not all toxins are removed, and it is these excess toxins that are accumulating in your body that are said to be the primary cause that weakens your nervous system, immune system, and cellular respiration; leading your seemingly healthy self to poor health.
</p>
<h2>Ask, and it will be given to you.</h2>
<p>Since your organs play a vital role in your body functioning at 100% health, don’t you think you should do your best and provide them with the proper fuel to function at their best in return?  There is a simple way to do this, that is not complicated in any way, and has the possibility of changing your health for the rest of your life. Anyone can follow the easy and affective 3Rs System, discovered by me. Comprising of 3 easy steps: remove, replace, and rotate. This is all that is required to start shedding those invisible, bad toxins in your body, which in turn, helps to keep you healthy and feel your best.
</p>
<h2>Introducing the 3Rs System: Remove, restore, and rotate</h2>
<p>Do you think this sounds like a recycling program more than a health program? Sounds easy, perhaps a little too easy? How has this not been taught before now? I can assure you that the 3Rs System has been tested and proven to work not on hundreds, but on thousands of patients that have come through my office. People like you, who are looking for answers because they are suffering from a variety of ailments. When was the last time you woke up and felt amazing? People like you are initially skeptical, but they have been turned to believers and advocates because it simply works.
</p>
<h2>Will the 3Rs System work on me?
</h2>
<p>I’ve heard this countless times before, “Just because something works on you, doesn’t mean it will work on me, right?” Yes it will. This is because the 3Rs System does not involve some unnecessary medical model that proposes the customization of healthcare, with medical products being tailored to you for effectiveness. It does not involve personalized medications that require your medical history. In fact, it does not involve any medications or products at all. They are simply steps, along with advice, that are designed to improve a number of your body’s systems and functions. <b>That’s all! No fuss, no mess!</b>
</p>
<h2>What the 3Rs System is not.
</h2>
<p>The 3Rs System is  not a series of required exercises,  a juice or smoothie fast, or a motivational system. It is not something that requires you to bust it at the gym, or join scheduled classes with a trainer. A lifestyle change is also not required, but merely a few simple dietary steps for you to follow. Steps, that when adhered to for a couple of weeks, could potentially be turned into positive, healthy habits. This could be part of your daily routine which shapes your health.
</p>
<p>That’s right! The 3Rs System is designed to not only provide you with steps for better health today, but also to practice good habits that could bode well for your future health. It can also strengthen your immune system, boost your energy, and protect you from the damaging effects of stress.
</p>
<h2>It’s only human nature that you don’t believe something can happen until you see proof. </h2>
<p>With so many health benefits attainable in a few simple steps, it is easy to see that the 3Rs System provides the definite answer to a healthier, happier you, both physically, emotionally, spiritually, and mentally. But anything that is decidedly good will inevitably attract a great deal of skeptics as well. Without exception, the 3Rs System has its fair share of them too. Can I blame anyone for having doubts? After all, we have been taught that if something is too good to be true, it probably is, right?
</p>
<p>Well, I can spend a lot of time explaining the benefits of the 3Rs System, but I am a doctor who has been board certified in family practice for over 25 years and have seen the benefits first hand. Instead, let me share with you my own personal experience and a few customer testimonials on how the 3Rs System has improved their conditions, and enabled thousands to lead a full and active life in good health.
</p>
<h2>The 3R story is a story of affirmation and encouragement.
</h2>
<p>Before I had discovered the 3Rs System and made it my goal to promote it all over the world, I was struck with the terrible diseases of IBS and Psoriasis. I could not find any answers for my symptoms. I had tried every known method to find a cure using supplements, pills, prescription medication, and even herbal drinks. Nothing was working. In fact, I was even feeling worse than before due to the side effects of the medication, which were causing me nausea, constipation, diarrhea, and drowsiness. This was also followed by a loss of appetite and low-energy. I was determined to return to a normal, healthy life. After much research, I began taking matters into my own hands, and started to try to find a cure for the diseases, not just treat the symptoms.
</p>
<p>
    As I was going through some key data while writing my first book, I stumbled across the secret to restoring my health, which I now refer to as the 3Rs System. The more that I learned about it, the more intrigue I was. The best part was that the 3Rs System was completely safe and natural, not to mention effective, as it had completely rid me of my diseases within a very short period of time from implementing it. There’s absolutely no reason why you shouldn’t start this system today too!
</p>
<h2>I swear by the 3Rs System.
</h2>
<p>I would not endorse the 3Rs System had I not tried it and seen the results first hand for myself.  Through my personal account of the 3Rs System, I can attest to the effectiveness of how the 3Rs System has helped rid me of my disease, but realize that its efficacy is not just limited to that. The 3Rs System can also help you <strong>lose weight, remove toxins from your body, restore balance to your body’s systems, improve skin quality, improve memory function, prevent chronic disease, increase energy, improve liver and kidney function, and improve your overall quality of life.</strong>
</p>
<p>But don’t just take my word for it. Listen to what other users have to say:
</p>
<h2>Customer Testimonials
</h2>
<blockquote><i>This 3Rs System was actually easier than I thought it would be, and I must say the results speak for themselves.  I lost eight pounds and my blood pressure has dropped to 110/70. I have an heightened sense of smell. I also was able to focus at work easier, and my ability to meditate and pray was easier as I wasn't agitated. This is the best way to start the New Year, and dare I say it, I am looking forward to the next one.

<blockquote>
    <i>The 3Rs System was just awe-inspiring. I realized I had so much energy that I was buzzing around the house doing projects I had been putting off for months after implementing it. On Sunday, afternoon my dog and I went for a long hike in a wilderness area not far from my house. The colors, smells, and sights seemed to be so intense I sometimes felt like I was under the influence of a narcotic! I only wish there was a way I could convert and convince more people of the value of this.

<h2>A Real Answer to Restoring Your Health
</h2>
<p>The 3Rs System is simply a system that helps you <strong>remove</strong> bad habits from your life that are hindering your health, <strong>replace</strong> those habits with very unique habits, and <strong>rotate</strong> them according to my system. It is said that habits turn into learned behaviors, and any bad habit affecting your health will <b>therefore be</b> bad for you in the long run. Well, the time is now to put a stop to this once and for all and let good habits take over. Let good health prevail instead. Start making a change in your life because you deserve to it. You have a right to live the abundant life that you are entitled to!
